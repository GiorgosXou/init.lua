# init.lua
An attempt to bring NVIM experience closer to VSCode users. This just is a custom `init.lua` based on a template, powered by AstroNvim. As well as a way of providing you with the capabilities of NVIM throught the familiarity of VSCode's keybindings.

## Why though?
Because :
* I wanted to make NVIM experience more easy peasy lemon squeezy to everyone
* I wanted to learn NVIM and what's the best way of learning it besides doing exactly this?
* My first\virgin experience got me stuck inside NVIM therefore I had to call my step-sis to get me unstack\exit
* Sometimes I think that NVIM limmits the user experience inside insert mode, just a tiny litle bit. *(TRIGGERED | not the actual reason! stoop it! pls!)*
